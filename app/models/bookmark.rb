# A bookmark must be linked to a movie and a list, and the [movie, list] pairings should be unique.

# You canâ€™t delete a movie if it is referenced in at least one bookmark.
# When you delete a list, you should delete all associated bookmarks (but not the movies as they can be referenced in other lists).
